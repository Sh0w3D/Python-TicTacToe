# Python-TicTacToe
simple python Tic Tac Toe game with custom made board and functions.
This code will be updated and will have more functions.
I'll add to this code:
1. Winner checking > done✔ on 27.09.2021,
2. Tie checking > done✔ on 27.09.2021,
3. Database connection > done✔ on 06.10.2021,
4. User win/lose/tie count information display - from database to excel or console window,
5. Game types:
  5a. User vs User > done✔,
  5b. User vs Bot > done✔ on 06.10.2021,
6. Thinking bots❓

"test.py" is a file created for simple function testing and does not contain real tests❗
If you want to play the game please make sure you have installed:
1. PyMySQL -> pip(3) install pymysql
2. MySQL database or PHPMyAdmin with imported databse
(I will export the code the next day)
